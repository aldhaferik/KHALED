  <h1>Dual Statements: Traditional vs Sustainable Financials</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction to Dual Financial Statements</h2>
    <p>
      A key innovation in this research is the introduction of <strong>dual financial statements</strong>—reporting both <strong>traditional</strong> and <strong>sustainable</strong> accounts side by side. This approach provides maximum transparency and accountability in how resource rents and user costs are recognized.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Traditional statements</strong> report based on historical cost and conventional depletion/depreciation.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainable statements</strong> integrate user-cost deduction, SWACC, and sustainability metrics to reflect intergenerational equity and responsible stewardship.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Traditional Accounting Fails</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ignores resource depletion externalities and the cost to future generations.</li>
      <li>Masks the erosion of natural capital and societal wealth in resource-based economies.</li>
      <li>Fails to incentivize or reflect sustainable reinvestment.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Sustainable Statement Adjustments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User-Cost Deduction:</strong> A portion of resource rent is earmarked for future generations and deducted from net income.</li>
      <li><strong>SWACC Discounting:</strong> The sustainable cost of capital (SWACC) is applied to all future cash flows.</li>
      <li><strong>Recognition of Green/Social CapEx:</strong> Capital invested in sustainability is highlighted, not buried in general CapEx.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <strong>net result</strong> is a more honest picture of true performance, sustainability, and risk.

    <h2>How To Build Dual Statements</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start with standard IFRS/GAAP accounts.</li>
      <li>Deduct the calculated <strong>User Cost</strong> after net income.</li>
      <li>Restate investment returns using <strong>SWACC</strong> instead of classic WACC or discount rates.</li>
      <li>Disclose all green/social CapEx, carbon, and human capital investments explicitly.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> See the methodology section for the full equations and Excel model.

    <h2>Academic and Practical Significance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Enables stakeholders, regulators, and society to compare actual sustainability performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Investors and citizens can see if rents are truly future-proofed, not consumed.</li>
      <li><strong>Policy Implications:</strong> Supports sustainable tax policy, royalty design, and resource management.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Novelty:</strong> This dual reporting system is one of the first of its kind, offering a rigorous, actionable framework for sustainable resource accounting.
