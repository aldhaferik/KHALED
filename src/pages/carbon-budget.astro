<h1>Carbon Budget Accounting</h1>

### A finite atmospheric reserve  
Like a copper deposit, the atmosphere has a limited **CO₂ budget** consistent with 1.5 °C. Treat that allowance as **another depletable asset** :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.

### Carbon depletion expense  
If Anglo American’s operational budget is 50 Mt CO₂ (2021-2040) and it emits 4 Mt this year, it must book a **carbon depletion charge** equal to 4 Mt × internal carbon price (e.g., $50 = $200 M) :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}.

| Year | Emissions (Mt) | Budget used | Budget left |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2020 | 4.5 | – | 50.0 |
| 2023 | 3.6 | 11.6 Mt | 38.4 Mt |
| …    | …  | … | … |

Failing to recognise that cost today leaves firms unprepared for future offset or abatement spending and overstates sustainable income.
