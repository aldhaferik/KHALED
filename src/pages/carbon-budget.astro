  <h1>Carbon Budget and Planetary Boundaries</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Carbon Budgeting Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional financial accounting treats CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as externalities—ignored in the balance sheet. However, the planetary boundaries framework recognizes that exceeding safe carbon budgets threatens not just companies, but the habitability of the planet itself.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Carbon budget:</strong> The maximum amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can be emitted to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C.</li>
      <li><strong>Planetary boundaries:</strong> Scientifically defined limits for critical earth systems, including climate, water, and biodiversity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your research shows how integrating these concepts into accounting radically improves risk assessment, strategy, and disclosure for extractives and heavy industry.

    <h2>Your Novel Contribution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Defines <strong>company-level carbon budgets</strong> by allocating the global budget down to firms, sectors, and assets.</li>
      <li>Links financial statements to planetary boundaries, so sustainability is not just a narrative—but a quantitative constraint.</li>
      <li>Proposes rigorous, enforceable methods for integrating carbon into user cost, SWACC, and financial performance measures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Calculate a Carbon Budget</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start with the global carbon budget (IPCC data).</li>
      <li>Allocate to your sector (e.g., oil, gas, mining) based on best available science and policy targets.</li>
      <li>Downscale to the company or project level, accounting for reserves, production forecasts, and abatement potential.</li>
      <li>Deduct carbon already emitted or committed through existing operations.</li>
    </ol>
    <div style="background:#f6f8fa;padding:1em;border-radius:8px;margin:1em 0;">
      <strong>Equation:</strong> <br/>
      <code>
        Company Carbon Budget = (Global Budget) × (Sector Share) × (Company Share) − (Emitted + Committed CO<sub>2</sub>)
      </code>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Integration With Financial Reporting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> Recognize “carbon liabilities” if reserves exceed future budget.</li>
      <li><strong>Profit & Loss:</strong> Deduct user cost and abatement investments from income.</li>
      <li><strong>SWACC:</strong> Discount future cash flows at a higher, risk-adjusted rate for “carbon non-compliance.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is a **paradigm shift**: companies face direct balance-sheet consequences for exceeding their fair share of the world’s carbon budget.

    <h2>Practical Example: Oil Company Carbon Budget</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> A national oil company holds reserves that, if fully developed, would emit 10 GtCO<sub>2</sub>. The company’s allocated budget for 2024–2050 is 3 GtCO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reserves above 3 GtCO<sub>2</sub> become “stranded assets.”</li>
      <li>Balance sheet must disclose these stranded reserves and associated impairment losses.</li>
      <li>Net income is reduced by user cost and carbon abatement expenses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Significance for Stakeholders</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Investors:</strong> Gain visibility on climate risk and asset stranding.</li>
      <li><strong>Policy makers:</strong> Enforce compliance through transparent accounting standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Society:</strong> Ensure that resource wealth is not traded for planetary destabilization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>This approach operationalizes sustainability, making it measurable and enforceable for the first time in financial accounting.</strong>
