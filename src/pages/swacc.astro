<h1>Sustainability-Weighted Cost of Capital (SWACC)</h1>

### From WACC to SWACC  
A single discount rate cannot serve two masters. **SWACC** blends the firm’s market WACC and a lower *social* rate:

\[
r_\text{eff} \;=\; (1-\lambda)\,r_\text{corp} \;+\; \lambda\,r_\text{social}
\]

where  
* λ = 0 → status-quo finance, λ = 1 → full social perspective :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.

### Why it matters  
Lower \(r_\text{eff}\) → higher present value of future depletion → **bigger user-cost charge** :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.  
At λ = 0.5, Freeport’s effective rate falls to 5.5 % and ~26 % of EBITDDA must be reserved for replacement capital :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}.

### Practical guidance  
1. **Disclose λ** and the rationale (regulators may one day require λ = 1).  
2. Report sensitivity (λ = 0, 0.5, 1) so investors see the range of sustainable income.  
3. Keep λ consistent year-to-year or justify changes :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.
