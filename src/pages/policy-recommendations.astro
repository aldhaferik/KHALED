## 8  Policy Recommendations (`policy-recommendations.astro`)

```md
<h1>Policy Roadmap</h1>

1. **Mandate supplementary “Statement of Resource Earnings & Reinvestment”** in financial reports (SEC, IASB).  
2. **Tax incentives** for firms that re-invest ≥ user-cost threshold into green or diversification projects.  
3. **Standard-setter guidance** on user-cost methodology and SWACC disclosure :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}.  
4. **Carbon-budget notes**: require disclosure of remaining corporate CO₂ allowance and depletion charges.  
5. **Encourage blockchain pilots** for ESG data to ensure verifiability of user-cost deposits.  

Adopting these measures aligns corporate accounting with inter-generational equity and accelerates the transition to a resource-constrained, low-carbon economy :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}.
