  <h1>Traditional vs Sustainable Accounting</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The resource sector—oil, gas, minerals—has traditionally relied on conventional accounting models that focus on immediate financial returns and capital maintenance, not long-term sustainability. <strong>User Cost Accounting (UCA)</strong> is a novel approach that corrects this, aligning financial reporting with stewardship, intergenerational equity, and the preservation of natural capital.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Traditional Accounting Falls Short</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ignores Depletion:</strong> Fails to deduct the true cost of resource depletion and the need for future replacement.</li>
      <li><strong>No Sustainable CapEx Signal:</strong> Treats all capital expenditure (CapEx) the same, regardless of its long-term or sustainable value.</li>
      <li><strong>Dividends Over Reinvestment:</strong> Prioritizes current payouts rather than reinvesting in future-proof assets.</li>
      <li><strong>Short-termism:</strong> Reports income as if the resource is infinite, not finite.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Makes Sustainable UCA Different?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User Cost Deduction:</strong> UCA deducts a "user cost" from income to account for the extraction of non-renewable resources, encouraging reinvestment in sustainable assets.</li>
      <li><strong>Seed Corn Principle:</strong> Echoes the agrarian rule: Don’t eat the seed corn. Only surplus beyond what's needed to sustain the resource base should be distributed.</li>
      <li><strong>Comprehensive Reinvestment Requirement:</strong> UCA enforces a minimum threshold for reinvestment in renewable or future-proof capital.</li>
      <li><strong>Dual Statement Model:</strong> Provides both traditional and sustainable income statements for transparency.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrates Human, Social, and Natural Capital:</strong> Goes beyond financials to include impacts on people and ecosystems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Equations & Illustrations</h2>
    <h3>User Cost Formula</h3>
    <pre>
User Cost (UC) = [Net Present Value (NPV) of resource income if depleted sustainably]
                 - [NPV if depleted as in current period]
    </pre>
    <h3>Traditional Income Statement (Simplified)</h3>
    <pre>
Revenue
- Operating Costs
= Gross Profit
- Depreciation/Depletion (partial)
= Net Profit (overstates true profit)
    </pre>
    <h3>Sustainable UCA Income Statement (Simplified)</h3>
    <pre>
Revenue
- Operating Costs
- Full Depletion (User Cost)
- Minimum Sustainable CapEx
= Net Distributable Surplus (true income)
    </pre>
