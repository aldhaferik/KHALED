<h1>Conventional Accounting vs. Sustainable Accounting</h1>

### Why conventional profit is often an illusion  
Under U.S. GAAP or IFRS, revenue from extracting copper, oil, or gas is booked as income while the depletion of the underlying resource is recognised only at historical cost, if at all. A mining firm can therefore appear highly profitable **while in fact liquidating its natural capital** :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
Research on “genuine savings” shows those overstated earnings create a false sense of prosperity and can even coincide with **declining national or corporate wealth** :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

### Hicks, Keynes and El Serafy  
- *Hicksian income* = the amount one can consume “without reducing the ability to consume the same in the future.”  
- *Keynes’s user cost* revived by **El Serafy** splits every dollar of resource rent into  
  1. **True income** – can be distributed, and  
  2. **User cost** – must be reinvested so future income is undiminished :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

### Sustainable accounting in one sentence  
> “Treat a portion of resource revenue as a depreciation charge on natural capital.” :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

That single adjustment converts overstated, unsustainable profits into **Hicks-consistent income** and forces management to answer a simple question: *Where is the replacement capital?*

*Key takeaway* – Without an explicit user-cost deduction, reported profits in extractive industries are **structurally inflated** and mislead shareholders, lenders, and policy-makers.
