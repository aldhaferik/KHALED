## 7  Blockchain & Data Transparency (`blockchain-transparency.astro`)

Sustainable metrics are only credible if stakeholders trust the data. A **blockchain-based ESG ledger** stores immutable records of production, emissions, and reinvestment flows, deterring green-washing :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}.

**Conceptual architecture**  
1. ERP & sensor data feed a permissioned chain.  
2. Each user-cost transfer mints a token (proof of reinvestment).  
3. Auditors and investors verify tokens in real-time.
