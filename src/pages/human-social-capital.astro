## 6  Human & Social Capital Costs (`human-social-capital.astro`)

```md
<h1>Human and Social Capital User Cost</h1>

### Why intangibles matter  
Accidents, skill loss, or community conflict **erode the very capacity that supports future cash flow** yet rarely appear on financial statements. The framework extends user-cost logic to these intangibles :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}.

| Capital | Example metric | User-Cost proxy |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Human** | Training hours needed to replace lost skills | Cost of training & recruitment |
| **Social** | Community impact score, disputes per year | Annual community-investment requirement |

Recording a **Human-Capital Depreciation** expense each year ensures reinvestment in training and safety; a **Social-Capital Reserve** funds community programmes, preventing “social licence” depletion.
